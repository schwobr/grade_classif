# Grade classif
> Project for grade classification on breast tumors histological images. 


This project is a collaboration between _Thales Services_ and _Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse_. Its goal is to use deep learning models to classify histological scans of breast tumors between grade 1 and grade 3. Using this classifier, we can then hope to use it on grade 2 images to check if it is more _grade 1-like_ or _grade 3-like_, potentially helping the doctor chosing the right medication for the patient.
